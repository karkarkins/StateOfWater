In State of Water, players control a faucet-fallen drop of water determined to return to nature and back to the glorious water cycle. During their escape from the indoors, our water drop encounters various thirsty plants and a daunting kitchen landscape. Luckily, the powerful states of matter, liquid, solid, and gas, are at your disposal.

The fundamental mechanic of State of Water is the ability to shift through the different states of matter to affect gameplay.

By pressing the 1 key, players shift to the liquid state of water, Water, as Water players can run fast and can jump but cannot break destructible objects blocking the way.

By pressing the 2 key, players shift to the solid state of water, Ice, as Ice players are much heavier and can break destructible blocks, however at the cost of jumping and speed.

By pressing the 3 key, players shift to the gaseous state of water, Steam, as Steam players constantly float to reach otherwise unattainable heights, but cannot move horizontally very much.
